Greetings! I am currently a 4th-year PhD student in Seismology at University of Texas at Dallas. My supervisor is Prof.[[ Hejun Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dCUgUwYAAAAJ&hl=en)].

My research focuses on investigating the radial and azimuthal anisotropy structure of Australian Plate using adjoint tomography. Besides, I am also interested in resolution evaluation of inverted model, wave equation modeling and imaging techniques.
